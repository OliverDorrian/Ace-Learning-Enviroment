                    Flexbox is an excellent method to handle page layouts in CSS. 
                    It can manipulate the height and width of an item to occupy all the space within the 
                    parent container ("flex-container") and control the vertical and horizontal flow of each
                    child ("flex-items").

                <p class="SmallText">
                    A design pattern that can be tricky in responsive design is a sidebar that sits inline with some content. 
                    Where there is viewport space, this pattern works great, 
                    but where space is condensed, that rigid layout can become problematic.

                    Terminology Of Flex Boxes

                <p class="SmallText">
                    Flex-container and flex-item are the basic components in the flexbox layout. 
                    You can consider flex-container as a parent element on a page that contains children known as flex-items. 
                    The main idea behind the flex layout is that all the flex-items inside the 
                    flex-container are either laid out along the main axis or the cross axis as shown below:

                <p class="SmallText">
                    When working with flexbox you need to think in terms of two axes — the main axis and the cross axis. 
                    The main axis is defined by the flex-direction property, and the cross axis runs perpendicular to it. 
                    Everything we do with flexbox refers back to these axes, so it is worth understanding how they work from the outset.

                    Whether you’re building a site from scratch or with the Bootstrap CSS framework, 
                    you’ll need to have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS to create and customize 
                    your layouts.

                    A major challenge of building layouts is arranging and styling elements on the page. 
                    Do you want the elements to overlap or have space between them? 
                    Do you want the layout to be responsive? Do you want some text on the page to be 
                    centered and the rest left-aligned? These are just a few questions you’ll have to 
                    address as you code.

                    How to Center Text in Div in CSS
                </h1>
                <p class="SmallText">
                    Using CSS, you can center text in a div in multiple ways. The most common way is to 
                    use the text-align property to center text horizontally. 
                    Another way is to use the line-height and vertical-align properties.
                     The last way exclusively applies to flex items and requires the justify-content 
                     and align-items properties. Using this method, you can center text horizontally, 
                     vertically, or both. We'll take a closer look at each method below.
